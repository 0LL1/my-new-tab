# My new tab

My new tab is a Chrome extension that replaces the default new tab page. It's tailored to my personal needs and consists of four main components:

1. **Stopwatch**. I use it in my daily training sessions.
2. **Timer**. I use it mainly when making coffee, tea or food.
3. **Scheduled matches**. So that I never miss FC Barcelona's match.
4. **Main tasks of today**. Basically a to-do list but for max three tasks that should be the focus of the day.

Color scheme is based on Chrome's new dark mode and macOS's native colors. Layout was designed to fit my 13" Retina display and bigger.
